LibZip - Create very low weight self executables. This is the generator of TinyPerl.

###############
# DESCRIPTION #
###############

This module will create low weight self executables, that have this features:

 * Perl library compressed in a lib.zip file.
 * Zlib compiled inside the executable (binary).
 * Initialize Package code is compressed in the sources.
 * Appended code to the executable can be compressed with LZW.
 * Remove POD from the source of files inside lib.zip.
 * Can work with UPX to automatically compress the binaries inside lib.zip.

All this featues will generate a I<Initialize Package> of only 28 Kb,
and a executable of less than 80Kb (Win32), plus PerlLib. This means that a 
hellow world script as a self executable will have only 350KB (Win32).
